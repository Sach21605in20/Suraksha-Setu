Read these files before writing any code:
- docs/PROGRESS.md
- docs/PRD.md
- docs/APP_FLOW.md
- docs/TECH_STACK.md
- docs/FRONTEND_GUIDELINES.md
- docs/BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md
- docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

Today's task: [SPECIFIC TASK]

Rules:
- Read docs/PROGRESS.md
- Follow docs/workflow-guides/git-integration.md for commits
- Follow docs/workflow-guides/verification-patterns.md before 
  marking done, applying its principles to the stack in 
  docs/TECH_STACK.md not the React examples in the guide
- Follow docs/workflow-guides/checkpoints.md before moving to next task
- verify every success criteria checkbox, update docs/PROGRESS.md when complete
- No stubs, no placeholders, no TODO comments

**When building logic-heavy things like the risk scoring engine:**

- For business logic, follow docs/workflow-guides/tdd.md
